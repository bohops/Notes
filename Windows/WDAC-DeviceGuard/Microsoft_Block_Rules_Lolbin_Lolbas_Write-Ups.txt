Public Write-Ups for Lolbins|Libraries|Scripts within the "Microsoft Recommended Block Rules"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules
 - Focus is on signed/trusted binaries that can be used as a vector for executing unsigned, arbitrary code
 - Offense: Lolbins|Libraries|Scripts may bypass Application Control solutions (e.g. Device Guard/WDAC) or other endpoing security controls depending on configuration
 - Defense: Consider monitoring these as a supplement/compliment to LOLBAS [https://lolbas-project.github.io/]
